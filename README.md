Introduction: "In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of hotel data to help management understand key performance indicators such as ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), and occupancy rates. My main focus was on extracting insights from various booking platforms and using Power BI to create a dashboard for real-time decision-making."

Project Overview:

Objective:
"The primary goal was to analyze the hotelâ€™s performance data to track trends in revenue, booking platforms, and room occupancy, ultimately providing the hotel management with data to make more informed decisions."

Data Sources:
"I worked with datasets including hostels.csv, rooms.csv, and bookings.csv. These files contained detailed information on room bookings, dates, and aggregated revenue data."

Tools:
"SQL was used for data aggregation, and Power BI was utilized to create visual reports and interactive dashboards."

Key Findings and Insights:

ADR and RevPAR Trends:
"I analyzed and visualized ADR and RevPAR metrics across various booking platforms, helping identify the most profitable platforms and booking trends."

Occupancy Rates:
"Occupancy rates were calculated and visualized, revealing peak periods and underperforming months."

City and Room Segmentation:
"I also created filters in Power BI for city, room type, and booking dates, allowing management to explore revenue and occupancy trends across various segments."
